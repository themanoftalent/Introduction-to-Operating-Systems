## Introduction to Operating Systems

**Description:**
This course serves as an introductory exploration into operating systems' fundamental concepts and functionalities. Students will delve into the core components of modern operating systems, such as process management, memory allocation, file systems, and device handling. Through a blend of theoretical discussions, practical exercises, and case studies, learners will develop a solid understanding of how operating systems orchestrate interactions between hardware and software, optimizing resource utilization and facilitating user experiences.

**Topics Covered:**
1. Overview of Operating Systems
2. Processes and Threads
3. Process Scheduling Algorithms
4. Memory Management Techniques
5. File Systems and Storage Management
6. Input/Output Management
7. Device Drivers and Handling
8. Security Mechanisms in Operating Systems
9. Virtualization and Containerization
10. Case Studies: Unix/Linux, Windows, macOS

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic familiarity with computer architecture and organization
- Proficiency in a high-level programming language (e.g., C, Java)

**Announcements:**
- Ensure you have access to a virtualization platform (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) for completing practical assignments.
- The midterm examination is scheduled for [date], covering material discussed up to that point.
- Industry professionals will deliver guest lectures throughout the semester, offering insights into real-world operating system implementations and challenges.

**Updates:**
- Added a new lab assignment to implement and analyze various process scheduling algorithms.
- Extended the deadline for the file systems project to accommodate student requests.
- Additional reading materials on security mechanisms within operating systems were included.
